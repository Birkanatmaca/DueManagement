# Security Considerations

## ⚠️ Important Security Notes

### Before Production Deployment:

1. **Password Hashing**: 
   - Current: SHA256 (insecure)
   - Recommended: bcrypt with cost factor 12+

2. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Current: Allows all origins (`*`)
   - Recommended: Specify exact allowed domains

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - ✅ `.env` file is properly ignored
   - ✅ Database credentials are not hardcoded

4. **Token Management**:
   - Current: In-memory storage (lost on restart)
   - Recommended: Database storage with expiration

5. **HTTPS**:
   - Required for production
   - All API calls should use HTTPS

### Security Checklist:

- [ ] Upgrade password hashing to bcrypt
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Implement token persistence in database
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Implement proper logging
- [ ] Add security headers
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Regular security audits

### Current Security Status:

✅ **Safe to push to Git** - No sensitive data exposed
⚠️ **Not production ready** - Security improvements needed
